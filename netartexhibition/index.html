      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>While it is so mundane that one typically wouldn't think about it, the mouse cursor is a crucial part of navigating the web on a computer. Perhaps it is even the most important thing; after all, there would be no visiting websites if one had no way to choose which website to go to, or even open the web browser. The commonly-used term to 'click' on something would never have arisen without it. And yet, despite the importance of its function, the mouse cursor is so regular a sight that it barely registers to web browsers the world over. In honor of its underappreciated nature, this collection of net art works is themed around simply moving the mouse. In this case, the mundanity of needing to move the mouse translates to versatility, and net works of many styles can be displayed even though they all share this method of control. Whether they be meant to allow you to mimic the style of a famous artist or find images of people pointing at the pointer for your amusement, all the pieces gathered here can be enjoyed with no input outside of the movement of the mouse cursor and the occasional click. </p>
