  <h2>Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow</h2>
  
  <p><b>Tomorrow</b>, and tomorrow, and tomorrow,<br>
  Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,<br>
  To the last syllable of recorded time;<br>
  And all our yesterdays have lighted fools<br>
  The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!<br>
  Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player,<br>
  That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,<br>
  And then is heard no more. It is a tale<br>
  Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,<br>
  Signifying &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nothing.<br>
  <br>
  From <em>Hamlet</em> by William Shakespeare<br>
