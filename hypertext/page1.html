    For a man of Pierce Sutherland's standing, his country house is surprisingly quaint, though you suppose it likely pales in comparison to the wealth of other properties he owns. <br><br>
    
    Owned. The man is dead now, and that's also the you're here. <br> <br>

    You make your way up the gravel path to the man standing by the front entrance of the single-story home. He peers at you over the rims of his glasses. "Ah, inspector," he says. "It's good that you're here. We were all starting to get a bit antsy, waiting to begin." He steps aside to give you access to the door. "My name is Officer Cedric Owens, if you weren't already aware. I'm here to help you however I can." <br> <br>

    As you exchange pleasantries, you open the door and step inside, Owens following after you. "We should be able to resolve this fairly quickly, I think." He leads you down a lamp-lit hallway. "Aside from the victim himself, there were only four other people in the house at the time of death: his wife, son, and two servants, his maid and secretary. It's pretty unlikely to have been an outside job. I had a man go around to every possible entrypoint in the house, and they were all secure and showed no signs of tampering." <br> <br>

    Turning a corner at the end of the hallway reveals a door, nondescript in every way but for the officer guarding it. When he sees you and Owens, he nods and makes way for you to enter the room. "Well," says Owens, "this here is Sutherland's study, the scene of the crime. It's been untouched since we got here. Shall we?" <br> <br>

    You open the door and enter the <a href=study.html>[study]</a>.
