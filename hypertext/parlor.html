    The parlor is a rather small room, and likely not used much. In the center of it, two plush couches surround a low table. A trophy cabinet looms over  the room, filled with little glass trinkets.
    <br> <br>
    A young man perches on one of the couches, tapping his foot. His arms are crossed, and he looks anything but pleased. 
    <br> <br>
    Owens leans over to you as you enter the room. "This is Adam Sutherland, the victim's son." His voice is low, so as to keep Adam from hearing him. "He's... a bit of a handful, so to speak, so perhaps it would be better to keep this one quick."
    <br> <br>
    Adam looks over at you when you arrive. "How much longer is this going to take? You've basically imprisoned me in my house, for Christ's sake."
    <br> <br>
    You assure him that things shouldn't take much longer, then ask him about his whereabouts for the day.
    <br> <br>
    Adam purses his lips. "I was in my bedroom the whole day. I'm an author, so I was working on my next novel. My room is on the other side of the house from father's study, and the only time I left it was to call the maid to fetch me a drink. Ran straight into her, then, screaming her pretty head off about finding a corpse. Couldn't be bothered dealing with that, so I turned around and went straight back." He huffs. "If you ask me, she's probably the one who did it. Stabbed him, or whatever it is she did, then ran off pretending to have discovered the body."
    <br> <br>
    You thank him for his time, and promise to be done with things quickly. He snorts and waves you away.
