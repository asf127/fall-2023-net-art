    You enter the library to see walls laden with books. It seems someone in the Sutherland family is a heavy reader.
    <br> <br>
    A young man sits at a table near the center of the room. He is reading a novel, though he sets it down when he notices you've entered. 
    <br> <br>
    "This is Mr. Cecil Woods, the victim's secretary," Owens states.
    <br> <br>
    Cecil smiles warmly at you as you approach. "I assume you have questions," he says. "Please, ask away."
    <br> <br>
    You ask him about his alibi.
    <br> <br>
    "Mr. Sutherland had not required my presence this afternoon, so I had some down time. I typically spend it here, in the library, and today was no different. At some point during the afternoon, Mrs. Sutherland came in and we struck up a conversation about a book we both had read previously. We spoke a for quite some time until we heard a scream. I left Mrs. Sutherland here to investigate and ran into Hannah in the hallway. When she described the situation to me, I instructed her to report it to the police. My wife works in medicine, you see, so I had an inkling that something was not right. I returned to Mrs. Sutherland in the library afterwards."
    <br> <br>
    You thank him for answering your questions, and he smiles at you again. "Please," he says, "if you need me to clarify anything, feel free to come back."
