    The master bedroom holds a grand four-poster bed, its wooden posts carved with intricate designs. It must have cost a fortune.
    <br><br>
    A woman sits on nearby chaise lounge, reading. Her hands are decorated with golden rings with gemstones of all colors and sizes. Around her neck sits a gaudy diamond necklace. The gems glitter in the lamplight.
    <br><br>
    "This is Mrs. Rachel Sutherland, the victim's wife," Owens tells you.
    <br><br>
    Rachel looks up at you, then sets her book down. Her hands fall to her lap, resting atop crossed legs in a rather prim manner. You can't help but note that she's much younger than her husband, and that she doesn't seem very distraught by his death.
    <br><br>
    "Well?" She asks. "Do you have any questions for me?"
    <br><br>
    You ask her for her alibi at the time of the crime.
    <br><br>
    "I was in the library with Mr. Woods, Pierce's secretary. We were discussing a novel the two of us had both read recently, when we both heard a scream. Mr. Woods left to go see what happened, and I stayed behind until he returned and told me what happened. We were both still there when the police arrived." 
    <br><br>
    Owens nods at this. It seems he corroborates her story.
    <br><br>
    "Is that all?" she asks with an air of finality. 
    <br><br>
    You thank her for her time, and she picks up her book to resume reading.
