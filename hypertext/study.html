    Now this is closer to what you would have imagined for a man like Sutherland. The furniture looks needlessly expensive, and the walls are decorated with many of his various accolades. He must have spent a lot of time in here, before his death.
    <br> <br>
    Towards the back wall stands a stately mahogany desk.
    <br> <br>
    You peer at the top of Sutherland's desk. He appears to have been working on some sort of financial document when he died. You scan the visible text, and though you don't quite understand all of its jargon, you know enough to conclude its contents likely aren't relevant to the murder. The bottom half of the paper is completely blotted out with dark ink; it seems that he, or someone else, knocked over his inkwell. 
    <br> <br>
    Also on the desk are piles of more documents, a table clock, and a tray with a finely-crafted tea set on top of it. There is a half-empty tea cup on the tray, though the tea has long gone cold by now.
    <br> <br>
    There is a bookshelf tucked away in the corner.
    <br> <br>
    Overstuffed file folders of documents fill the shelves of the bookcase, arranged by year. Thankfully, you have no reason to believe that looking through all of these would be relevant to the case.  
    <br> <br>
    A folder catches your eye. It's unlabled, and significantly thinner than its brethren. It also looks as if it's been hastily shoved between the wall of the shelf and another file in a poor attempt to hide it. 
    <br> <br>
    You flip open the file and are met with what looks to be letters. Love letters, to be precise, addressed to Sutherland, from an assortment of women at that. Many of them are old, dating back to over two decades ago, though there is certainly no lack of recent dates. You scan through some of the names: Lacey Roberts, Caitlyn Weber, Jennifer Woods, Caroline Hammond. None of them sound familiar to you, so the women must not have been very high profile. 
    <br> <br>
    A further look reveals that some of the women have suddenly stopped communicating quite suddenly, despite having kept up with it for years. Did Sutherland have a reason to cut them off?
    <br> <br>
    On the floor, to the left-hand side of his desk, is Sutherland's corpse.
    <br> <br>
    Sutherland's body lays prone on the rug. He's cool to the touch, though that's not surprising given that you took some time to get here. You can see rigor mortis beginning to set in in the lines of his face, his muscles tensing. All in all, it's not a pleasant sight.
    <br> <br>
    "He was 56 years old, but he had a clean bill of health," Owens says. "It's unlikely he died of natural causes."
    <br> <br>
    Looking over his corpse, you can't seem to find any sign of injury. There are a few tiny bruises here and there, but nothing that would suggest even a minor physical altercation, much less one that ended in death. His lips, however, appear tinged blue, his flesh pale. Both are symptoms that are associated with asphyxiation, though nothing about his corpse suggests he was strangled, or that he choked on something. 
    <br> <br>
    In his right hand, he holds the pen he must have been writing with. His grip is hard enough that the pen has cracked. 
    <br> <br>
    "I've taken the liberty of dividing up the witnesses into separate rooms," Owens says. "Feel free to speak to them whenever you'd like."
