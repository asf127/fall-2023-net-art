    When you walk into the kitchen, you catch sight of a young woman aggressively scrubbing at the countertop with a damp rag. The countertop already looks perfectly clean to you, so you imagine she's doing this more so out of nervousness than a desire to actually accomplish anything.
    <br><br>
    "Miss Weaver?" Owens calls. She yelps and turns around. Her hands are trembling where she's gripping the washcloth. "My apologies if I've startled you. We just need to ask you some questions, if that's alright."
    <br><br>
    "Yes!" she cries, her voice reedy. "Yes, that's fine."
    <br><br>
    Owens turns to you. "Inspector, this is Miss Hannah Weaver, the Sutherland family's maid. She's also the one who first discovered the body."
    <br><br>
    You ask her about the discovery of the body.
    <br><br>
    Her expressions drops. "I found him when I went to go collect the tea tray I had brought him earlier in the day. When I first saw him, he was laying face-down on the rug, and I thought, as ridiculous as it sounds, that he must have been sleeping. I called out to him, but he wouldn't wake up, so I rolled him over and..." She clenches her fingers on her apron. "Oh, it was awful! It scared me so badly that I must have ran out screaming. I didn't know what to do, so I went to go fetch Cecil--he's Mr. Sutherland's secretary, if you didn't know. He always seems to keep a cool head in an emergency. When I described what I'd saw to him, he told me to call the police to report a murder." She pauses. "Ah, yes, I think I also ran into Mr. Adam around this time, but we didn't speak much. He saw me and seemed to turn back around."
    <br><br>
    You also ask her about her actions prior to the murder.
    <br><br>
    "It was a rather normal day until the... incident, so to speak. In the afternoon, I had gone to bring Mr. Sutherland his daily tea in his study. When I was exiting the kitchen, I bumped into Cecil, who had just been coming around the corner. I've always been rather clumsy, you see, so I almost dropped the tea set right there. He had to catch it, and thank God he did, because I don't know what I would have done if it had broken..." She shakes her head. "Anyway, I took the tea to Mr. Sutherland, and he dismissed me as usual, so I returned to the kitchen to prepare for dinner."
    <br><br>
    You thank her for her time.
