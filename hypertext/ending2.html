    The culprit is Cecil Woods; it has to be.
    <br> <br>
    The manner in which Pierce Sutherland died suggests poison, namely strychnine, which causes convulsions and eventual death via asphyxiation when the nervous system is paralyzed. He likely knocked over the inkwell on his desk while thrashing himself. 
    <br> <br>
    The only thing the victim had consumed recently up to the time of his death was the tea found on his desk, brought to him by Hannah Weaver, the maid. She, however, has no motive and no means to procure the poison used in Sutherland's death.
    <br> <br>
    There is only one other person who came into contact with the tea: Cecil Woods. Hannah brought the victim tea everyday, so it would be easy for Cecil to anticipate this and wait around the corner to catch her off guard. He poisoned it in the few moments he held the tea in his hands, while Hannah was busied with straightening herself up, before giving it back to her to deliver to the victim. His wife works in medicine, so he would have had increased access to various chemicals, and thus, the strychnine.

    As for a possible motive, you recall the file of letters you found in Sutherland's study, and in particular, the letters written by one Miss Jennifer Woods. While it might not strictly be the case, she may be of some relation to Cecil, perhaps a mother or a sister. The communication between Sutherland and many of the women cut off suddenly when it had previously continued regularly for many years. Something had clearly changed, and likely on Sutherland's end. Perhaps he was abandoning his mistresses the moment they grew boring to him, or once they became too big a burden. With them dating back for over two decades, it's entirely possible for him to have sired a bastard son or two who had since grown to be Cecil's age.

    When you tell Owens this, he whistles, impressed. "Sounds to me like you've got this one in the bag." He procures a pair of handcuffs from out of his pocket, and the two of you approach the double doors to the library.
    <br> <br>
    "Ready?" he asks you.
    <br> <br>
    You swing the doors open.
